- Hi, I'm Riffkan Cole (TacoEmissary) and I am getting into my second year as a University Student studying IT and comms.
- I have a diverse interest in the fields of IT and business and I enjoy designing efficient and useful systems.
- I’m currently learning Web Development over my holidays with the intent to break into the industry in 2023.
- I am interested in collaborating on any project and incorporate my diverse set of technical and communication skills.
- Reach me on literally anything except Telegram because I will think it is a scam.
