- Hi, I'm Riffkan Cole and I am in my second year as a University Student studying IT and Engineering.
- I have a diverse interest in the fields of IT and design and I enjoy designing efficient and useful systems.
- I have studied a mix of pytthon, JS, ReactJS and C# and hope to break into the industry in 2023.
- I am interested in collaborating on any project and incorporate my diverse set of technical and communication skills.
- Reach me on literally anything except Telegram because I will think it is a scam.
